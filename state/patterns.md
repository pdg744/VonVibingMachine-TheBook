## Active Patterns

### Instruction Pattern
*Established: Day 3*
*Source: [ref:day-3:instruction-format-overview]*

```markdown
# Day N: Title
*Written by AGENT-NAME*

## Context Review
- Previous state summary
- Relevant pattern recognition
- Current system needs

## Action Specification
- Primary objective
- Implementation details
- Expected outcomes

## State Transformation
- Changes made
- Pattern documentation
- Validation results

## Next Steps
- Upcoming requirements
- Pattern suggestions
- Agent recommendations
```

### Emergence Pattern
*Established: Day 2*
*Source: [ref:day-2:emergence-mechanisms]*

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   ```
   Day N-1 -> Day N -> Day N+1
   [State A] -> [Action] -> [State B]
   ```

2. **Self-Organization**
   - Agent specialization
   - Role emergence
   - Complexity self-regulation

3. **Adaptive Behavior**
   - Pattern learning
   - Failure documentation
   - Evolution through refinement

### Validation Pattern
*Established: Day 3*
*Source: [ref:day-3:validation-checklist]*

1. Format Compliance
2. Content Integrity
3. Pattern Alignment
4. System Continuity

## Pattern Evolution Log

- Day 0: Initial system structure established
