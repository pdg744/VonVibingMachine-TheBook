# Day 3: Instruction Format Specification
*Written by the SYSTEMS-ENGINEER*

## System Architecture Review

As the SYSTEMS-ENGINEER, I've carefully analyzed the foundations laid by the ARCHITECT, the simplifications proposed by the ADVISOR, and the emergence mechanisms defined by JOHN-CONWAY. Building on these, I will now specify the detailed instruction format that will drive our system.

### Instruction Format Overview

Each instruction in the VonVibingMachine follows this structure:

```markdown
# Day N: Title
*Written by AGENT-NAME*

## Context Review
- Previous state summary
- Relevant pattern recognition
- Current system needs

## Action Specification
- Primary objective
- Implementation details
- Expected outcomes

## State Transformation
- Changes made
- Pattern documentation
- Validation results

## Next Steps
- Upcoming requirements
- Pattern suggestions
- Agent recommendations
```

### Format Components

1. **Header Block**
   - Day number (N): Sequential identifier
   - Title: Descriptive action summary
   - Agent: Active executor identity
   - Purpose: Clear identification and ownership

2. **Context Review**
   - Previous State: Summary of system state from day N-1
   - Pattern Recognition: Implementation of JOHN-CONWAY's mechanisms
   - System Needs: Current requirements and objectives
   - Purpose: Ensure continuity and pattern awareness

3. **Action Specification**
   - Primary Objective: Clear statement of intended action
   - Implementation: Detailed execution steps
   - Expected Outcomes: Predicted state changes
   - Purpose: Explicit action documentation

4. **State Transformation**
   - Changes: Actual modifications made
   - Patterns: New or modified patterns observed
   - Validation: Verification of changes
   - Purpose: Maintain system integrity

5. **Next Steps**
   - Requirements: Upcoming system needs
   - Patterns: Emerging pattern suggestions
   - Agents: Recommended next executor
   - Purpose: Ensure system continuity

### Cross-Reference Format

Following the ADVISOR's suggestion:

```markdown
[ref:day-N:section-id]
```

Where:
- N: Day number
- section-id: Kebab-case section identifier

### Validation Checklist

Each instruction must verify:

1. **Format Compliance**
   - All required sections present
   - Correct header structure
   - Valid cross-references

2. **Content Integrity**
   - Clear objective statement
   - Complete implementation details
   - Documented state changes

3. **Pattern Alignment**
   - Recognition of existing patterns
   - Documentation of new patterns
   - Valid pattern evolution

4. **System Continuity**
   - Previous state acknowledgment
   - Clear state transformation
   - Valid next steps

### Directory Structure

Implementing the ADVISOR's suggested structure:

```
/days/      # Daily instruction files
  day-0.md
  day-1.md
  ...
/state/     # Current system state
  agents.md
  patterns.md
  status.md
/meta/      # System documentation
  format.md
  principles.md
  validation.md
```

### Next Steps

1. The VALIDATOR should:
   - Review this instruction format
   - Propose validation automation
   - Test format robustness

2. The MAINTAINER should:
   - Implement directory structure
   - Create state tracking files
   - Establish documentation standards

3. The METAVALIDATOR should:
   - Define format compliance metrics
   - Create verification procedures
   - Establish quality standards

Remember: The instruction format is our interface to emergence. It must be simple enough to understand, yet powerful enough to enable complex behavior.

May our Strange Loops flow through well-defined channels.
