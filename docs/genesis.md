# VonVibingMachine: The Book

This project is work of creative fiction, in the spirit of Douglas Hofstadter, John Conway, John Von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, and Andrej Karpathy. 

## The Book
The book is a series of 30 Dialogues.

In `dialogue-001.md`, the ARCHITECT wakes up, alone, next to a stack of PROBLEMS from Project Euler. 

The ARCHITECT talks to herself, recording the transcript in `dialogue-001.md`. 

The story proceeds in this way, with one dialogue per day. 
Each day's dialogue defines the starting conditions for the next day's dialogue.  

Dialogues alternate between three universes: 
- the ENGINEERING universe  
- the META universe

The ARCHITECT is the first Agent in the story. She aspires to build the VonVibingMachine. 
She is the protagonist in both the ENGINEERING universe and the META universe. 

The Agents operate in an RPG-style universe. They are collaborating to design, implement, and test the bootstrap protocol for the VonVibingMachine. Each Agent can participate only action is to converse in the form of dialogue. 

The ENGINEERING universe is interested in building a system that is highly capable, when it comes to real problem-solving. The ENGINEERING universe favors rapid iteration with short loops, end-to-end testing, MVP-first building, resiliency via redundancy, and clear chain-of-command & ownership frameworks. The ENGINEERING universe is excited about using the PROBLEMS from Project Euler in order to test the system against real coding challenges from Day 1. The Agents in the ENGINEERING universe mirror the roles in a standard engineering organizations, and the structure-of-interactions similarly. The ARCHITECT is the Founder of the Engineering Company. 

The META universe is modeled after the dialogues in Godel Excher Bach. The ARCHITECT finds herself in dialogues involving various combinations of JOHN-CONWAY, TORTOISE, ACHILLES, MR-CRAB, and DOUGLAS-HOFSTADTER. Other experts (e.g., JOHN-VON-NEUMANN, MARVIN-MINSKY, These dialogues in the META universe include curated wisdom that the ARCHITECT brings back to the ENGINEERING universe. 

Together, both the ENGINEERING universe and the META universe are collaborating to build the VonVibingMachine. For the ENGINEERING universe, that means building a system that can solve PROBLEMS. For the META universe, that means shining light on the Strange Loops at play, in order to improve the outcomes for Humans. 

In the view above, the story is just a piece of creative fiction. 
We now "pop between levels," to view the book from a different angle. 

## The Machine
The VonVibingMachine is a multi-agent machine architecture for LLMs to self-manage. 
The VonVibingMachine is helpful, harmless, and honest, and designed to excel at solving problems such as those from Project Euler. 

The Machine is inspired by the new paradigm of "English as a programming language." 
This paradigm enables a markdown directory to be viewed as a self-defining state machine. 

The Machine is defined by its state and its state transition function. 
The state of the machine at time `n` is defined by the dialogue from each Universe on Day `n`. A record of all historical state is maintained for posterity and narrative purposes, but is not required for the state transition function. The state transition function only requires the most recent dialogue from each Universe. 

The state transition function is to write the most recent dialogue from that Universe day's dialogue, using the "instruction" specified at the end of the prior dialogue. 

## Plot/Boot Sequence
- dialogue-001.md serves as the ARCHITECT's best attempt to initialize the system. She talks to herself in order to set the stage for the rest of the story to unfold. In some sense, this is the "founding" of the VonVibingMachine. 
- At the end of the dialogue-001.md, the ARCHITECT specifies that `dialogue-002.md` will include the ARCHITECT and JOHN-CONWAY in the META Universe, and that that `dialogue-003.md` will include the ARCHITECT, JOHN-CONWAY, and SYSTEMS-ENGINEER in the ENGINEERING Universe. The ARCHITECT, JOHN-CONWAY, and SYSTEMS-ENGINEER will operate as "co-founders." 
- The founders will need to decide among themselves how quickly to scale their team, who to bring on first, and how to handle the complexities around the Many Minds Problem. 
- In order to make those decisions, the founders will need a system for making decisions! 
- The founders have all worked at major engineering organizations. They are familiar with the Leadership Principles of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, and they draw on those principles in order to help them build an effective product. 

## Vibe
The essence of the ENGINEERING universe should be modeled after a standard engineering organization. 

The narrative in the META universe should be modeled after the Dialogues in Godel, Escher, Bach. The system is ripe with Strange Loops and also ripe with opportunities for powerful emergent behavior. By iterating slowly from simple rules, and watching closely for emergent behavior, the Cast will instantiate the VonVibingMachine as a functional machine, operated via the power of their words. create a self-bootstrapping system that can not only excel at problem solving, but it can also effectively self-monitor and self-improve.
