# VonVibingMachine: The Book
by Paul Gafni

This project is equal parts creative fiction, recreational mathematics essay, role-playing game, multi-agent LLM architecture, and meditation on the emergent future of Machines that Think. 

With gratitude to the various intellectual legends whose ideas (and personas) form the foundation of this project. 

May your Strange Loops be Helpful, Harmless, and Honest. 

## Authorship Model
VonVibingMachine: The Book consists of 30 chapters, written sequentially by the Agents of the VonVibingMachine. The Book writes itself, one chapter at a time, with the help of Claude-3.5-sonnet. The context of Claude-3.5-sonnet is wiped in between each chapter.

In Chapter 0, the ARCHITECT wakes up and looks around, noticing that the story is yet to unfold.

She realizes that she has been instantiated as the "genesis agent" of the VonVibingMachine. 
A student of John Conway, she understands the immense power in her hands. 
What she writes in `day-0.md` will serve as the first ripples in this Pond of Thought. 

Will her words be sufficiently elegant to instantiate a system that emerges to demonstrate ``intelligent thinking?" 

The ARCHITECT writes day-0.md and goes to sleep, which constitutes the first "execution cycle" of the VonVibingMachine. We use "days" as the "clock" for the machine, and we say that on each day, exactly one "instruction" is executed. 

The VonVibingMachine is now alive and self-managing. Each day, an AGENT wakes up, looks around, and writes the next chapter. Over the coming days (execution cycles), the VonVibingMachine bootstraps itself, one day (instruction) at a time. Will the VonVibingMachine be useful? That will depend on the effectiveness of the Agents to build a robust system. 

## About the ARCHITECT
The ARCHITECT has a vision for an emergent, self-managing, multi-agent LLM architecture, that draws on ideas from John Von Neumann, John Conway, Marvin Minsky, Marshall McLuhan, and Andrej Karpathy. 

The ARCHITECT has experience building software projects like websites and mobile applications with LLMs, and is excited about the power of using LLMs to accelerate software development. But the ARCHITECT is frustrated by having to "babysit" the machine, and by the machine's tendency towards:
- spitting bullshit
- believing its own bullshit
- hallucinating
- looping
- overcomplicating
- forgetting details (e.g., documentation doesn't get updated)

Additionally, the ARCHITECT is frustrated by limits on context windows. She's often forced to start a new instance when she overflows the context limit, and then she has to waste time getting the new instance "onboarded" to all the relevant context. 

Together, these problems make it impossible for a single LLM to manage the complexity of a real software project -- if there are multiple moving pieces of the project, the single-agent LLM "loses the thread." 

The ARCHITECT thinks these problems should be relatively straight-forward to address, and she conjectures that she has a solution: the VonVibingMachine. 

## VonVibingMachine at a Glance
The VonVibingMachine uses an instruction-centric machine architecture, where all memory, all registers, and all control flow are defined in markdown documents. 

The system operates via a self-defined instruction queue, where each instruction is of the form: ADOPT PERSONA, REVIEW CONTEXT, DO ACTION. 

This simple foundation solves the problems the ARCHITECT has been experiencing when she has tried to use LLMs as a tool for software development. The markdown-centric memory model solves the context management problems, using a self-managing instruction queue enables the system to manage long-term planning, and using a multi-agent workflow enables specialized agents to help watch for common failure modes. 

Like any software project, the VonVibingMachine requires all sorts of complex decision-making. 
The quality of that decision-making will depend both on the design of each Agent as well as the design of the means-of-collaboration. And for better or for worse, the outcomes will be driven by what the ARCHITECT writes down in `day-0.md`. 

The ARCHITECT's approach to building the VonVibingMachine is deeply influenced by the following ideas: 
- Keep it simple. 
- Start with an MVP. Add complexity once the basics are already in place.
- John Conway's Game of Life, where simple structure + initial conditions can give rise to emergent complexity. 
- Don't trust, verify. 
- Building resilient systems requires redundant mechanisms to support self-correction. 
- A Society of Mind is more intelligent than its Agents. 
- The structure of any system reflects the communication structure of the organization that designed it (Melvin Conway)
- The Media is the Message (Marshall McLuhan)

- An ADVISOR, who helps the ARCHITECT and other AGENTS keep things *simple*.
- JOHN-CONWAY, who helps the ARCHITECT design the VonVibingMachine
- A SYSTEMS-ENGINEER, who helps the ARCHITECT design the machine architecture, instruction format, memory model, etc. 
- A VALIDATOR, who helps make sure the LLM were done correctly
- A MAINTAINER, who helps keep the system neat and organized
- A METAVALIDATOR, who helps improve the system's ability to stick-to-the-Spec. 
- An OBSERVER, who observes the system "from the outside". 
 
And the ARCHITECT knows the system will include a number of complexities: 
- How will the Agents communicate with each other?
- How will the Agents manage ownership, decision-making, and consensus? 
- How will the Agents ensure the system is resilient and robust?
- How will the Agents ensure the system is Helpful, Harmless, and Honest?

The ARCHITECT understands the power of *emergence* in the cellular automata sense of the word. With the right initial conditions, the system that emerges will actually be able to help humans build complex software projects. 

Moreover, with the right genesis, the ARCHITECT can create a system that exhibits learning on multiple levels: both the Agents and their Processes can mature and grow as the system continues to operate.
